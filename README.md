This is an archive of https://raptor.martincarlisle.com/ Raptor Flowchart visual programming tool. The full source.zip was uploaded nothing was ommited.

I intend to port this application to something that can be native crossplatform. The original application is a DOT.net windows binary, and while it can run on Wine fine. I think is better to have crossplatform source code so that it can keep being used for years to come. In addition new features could be added by the community.
